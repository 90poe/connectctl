# connectctl
A kafka connect cli util. Currently it supports the following:

- `connectctl connectors manage`
- `connectctl connectors restart`

This is a work in progress project.

## Acknowledgements
The code in `pkg/client/connect` is originally from [here](https://github.com/go-kafka/connect) but has been modified for use in this utility.
